### Hi, my name is  Advait ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 16-year-old hobbyist developer from Germany. I'm also a Physics enthusiast and a speedcuber. 

I started programming in 2019 and my first language was Python. I have picked up quite a few languages
and frameworks since then, like ReactJs and ROOT. I'm not that experienced in programming, so please hit
me up if you have a project and want some help.  

I have developed an interest in CERN, as it combines all of my interests. As you can see from my development history, I like to contribute to CERN's repos and I generally like what they do. I dream to work there as a theoretical Physicist one day :D
